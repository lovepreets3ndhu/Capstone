## 🏥 Why This Project?  
Fog computing in **Healthcare IoT (HIoT)** involves managing tasks efficiently to **reduce**:  

📉 **Bandwidth Usage** 🚀 *(Less data transfer to the cloud)*  
⏳ **Latency** *(Faster processing at the fog layer)*  
🔋 **Energy Consumption** *(Optimized resource utilization)*  
💰 **Cost** *(Less operational expenses)*  

By using **CSA+SA+LF**, we achieve **optimal task scheduling** for **efficient resource allocation** in **fog networks**.
