# Cuckoo Search with Simulated Annealing and Lévy Flight for Optimizing Healthcare IoT in Fog Networks
Integrated Cuckoo algorithm with simulated annealing(for exploitation) and Lévy Flight Step (for exploration)
Project Overview
This project implements an optimized Cuckoo Search Algorithm (CSA) combined with Simulated Annealing (SA) and Lévy Flight (LF) to minimize bandwidth usage and latency in Healthcare IoT (HIoT) in Fog Computing.

Key Features:
✔️ Cuckoo Search Algorithm (CSA) for task allocation
✔️ Lévy Flight-based exploration for global optimization
✔️ Simulated Annealing (SA) for local optimization
✔️ Energy and cost analysis for optimized task scheduling
✔️ Scalable implementation with synthetic data generation

Why This Project?
Fog computing in healthcare IoT (HIoT) involves managing tasks efficiently to reduce:
Bandwidth usage 🚀 (Less data transfer to cloud)
Latency ⏳ (Faster processing at the fog layer)
Energy consumption 🔋 (Optimized resource utilization)
Cost 💰 (Less operational expenses)
By using CSA+SA+LF, we achieve optimal task scheduling for efficient resource allocation in fog networks.

How It Works?
Algorithmic Flow:
